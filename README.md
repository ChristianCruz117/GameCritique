### Marvel Spiderman

The Marvel Spiderman game is a single player game that’s it’s a fun action pack game open world game. 
The makers of Marvel Spiderman are Insomniac Games, and in the game, you can fight crime, collect collectables and do challenges.  
After playing the entire game in a couple days, I think there are a few things a game tester would look at.

One of the functions that the developers had to look at straight away was the web swinging for Spiderman. 
The web swinging needs to be tested because that’s how you are going to be traveling across the city, also you use it to fight criminals. 
Talking about fighting criminals they had to test the combat mechanics. 
When you play the game, you are going to be fighting many type of villains with different abilities that Spiderman needs to doge and counter if you don’t want to get hit by bullets rockets and many other things.
So, it’s very important they check that Spiderman moves are working properly and efficiently.  
The last thing they seriously need to check is Spiderman gadgets. 
Spiderman gadgets need to be checked because you use them to help you in the middle of the fight and solving puzzles.
If that didn’t work Spiderman wouldn’t be able to fight the way he should and be able to finish a fight really quickly.
